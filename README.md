1. Abstract
This project presents the development of a prompt-based AI application that adapts to user needs, stimulates creativity, and enhances practical problem-solving skills. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini, the system allows users to generate context-specific insights, ideas, and solutions. The application personalizes prompts according to the user‚Äôs profile, goals, and activity mode‚Äîfostering both critical and creative thinking through interactive AI collaboration.

2. Objectives
1.
To design a prompt-driven system that responds to personalized user goals.
2.
3.
To foster creative thinking and analytical reasoning through structured prompt templates.
4.
5.
To enable multi-model AI integration, comparing outputs across LLMs.
6.
7.
